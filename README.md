# Nestris x86

### Summary
This is a reimplementation of the original 1989 NES Tetris game using modern c++ compilers for modern computer hardware.  Nothing from the NES is being emulated here, this is a native implementation of the game for Windows / Linux / MacOs.  As a result there is no emulator lag.  However being a port, it is not identical, there are some aspects of the original game missing, whilst other features have been added.  It is the intent of this project to be as close as possible to the original NES game in terms of gameplay mechanics.
